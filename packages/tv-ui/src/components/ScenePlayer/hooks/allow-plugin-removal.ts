/** 
 * Hack to allow removal of plugins.
 * 
 * Video.js doesn't replace the options object with the one we return, it merges our updated options
 * object back into the original options object. Since a plugin is loaded based purely on the presence 
 * of a key in the options.plugins object simply deleting the key won't remove the plugin since it will
 * still be present in the original options object. To get around this we replace the whole plugins
 * object with a string which can't be merged and so will wipe out the original plugins object. In a second
 * beforesetup hook below we return the plugins property back to an object and there we can add back all plugins
 * minus any we want to remove.
 *
 * Another issue is that Stash's ScenePlayer which we're extending is written to assume various plugins are added and
 * removing them can cause errors. To get around this we only add stub implementations of the plugins we want to remove.
